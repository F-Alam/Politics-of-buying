## Politics-of-buying
Political ideology seems to play an important role in consumer behavior. While most of the recent studies
related to the intersection of political ideology and consumer behavior stems from analyzing survey and
opinion data, we wanted to test the theory and see whether political attitudes translated to actual purchase
and spending decisions exhibited by the consumers. The results of our experiment suggest that purchasing
decisions (i.e. whether they choose to buy a product or not ) is influenced by consumerâ€™s political ideology;
however we did not find any meaningful indication in the price they are willing to pay once the decision to
purchase was made.
